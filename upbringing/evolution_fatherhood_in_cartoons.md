## Theory: The Evolution of Father Figures in Animated TV Shows

Animated TV shows reflect how the role of fathers in society has evolved over time. Here's the general progression:

1. **1960s–1980s: Absent or Authoritarian Fathers**  
   - Fathers are either missing from the story or portrayed as strict authority figures.
   - Examples: *Heidi*, *Marco*
   - Children are often raised by mothers, grandparents, or even on their own.

2. **1980s–2000s: The Provider Father**  
   - Fathers go to work, mothers stay home to care for the children.
   - The father's role is more visible but still emotionally distant or clumsy.
   - Examples: *Shin-chan*, *The Simpsons*

3. **2000s–2010s: Emotionally Present but Passive Fathers**  
   - Fathers are at home and show affection but are not very active in play.
   - They support but don’t fully engage in their children’s imaginary or emotional world.
   - Example: *Peppa Pig*

4. **2010s–Today: Emotionally and Actively Involved Fathers**  
   - Fathers not only show affection but also engage in imaginative play.
   - They become companions in games, emotionally available, and deeply present.
   - Example: *Bluey*

**Conclusion:**  
Cartoons mirror the transformation of fatherhood in real life — from distant authority figures to emotionally and physically involved parents. This evolution also reflects changing work conditions, gender roles, and expectations around parenting.
